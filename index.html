  <h3> Over the last 10 years, basketball analytics has influence the league to shift to a three point heavy approach. As NBA athletes began to change their skillset around this development, players, specifically "bigmen" have become sharpshooters in the corners, leading to a more dynamic offensive approach.</h3>

  <p> The National Basketball Association has undergone a drastic change over the last few decades. The three-point shot was officially added to the NBA in 1979, the notable rookie season of Hall of Famers Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. At first, fans of the game and reporters claimed that the shot was a “gimmick” and that teams should not be wasting possessions on “bad shots”. Players already in the league were taught from a young age to get as close as they could to the basket and take the easiest shot. This mindset caused the three-point shot to be a rarity in its inaugural season, with only 1 player eclipsing 75 three-pointers. The league wrote off the three-point shot, thinking it would not last.</p>

  <p>Just 20 years ago, the NBA was an offensive environment focused predominantly on the pick-and-roll and post-play from physical centers such as Shaquille O'Neal and Tim Duncan. During this era, three-point shooters were few and far between. Ray Allen, drafted in 1996, was the first true three-point specialist, averaging 5.7 three-point attempts per game and shooting 40 percent from downtown for his career. Allen, while an all-around player who was above average at driving and playmaking, was always a three-point shooter first. Especially later in his career, Allen became the premier shooter on multiple championship-winning teams with the Boston Celtics in 2008 and the Miami Heat in 2013. </p>

  <p>Allen is credited with making one of the most memorable three-point shots in NBA history in Game 6 of the 2013 NBA finals against the San Antonio Spurs. Down 3 games to 2 in the finals, Ray Allen hit a corner three-pointer with 5 seconds left to tie the game and eventually send it into overtime, where the Miami Heat won. This shot is memorable for a plethora of reasons, but one reason that is not credited enough is that it was the only three-pointer he made the entire game. It also just so happened to be a corner three-pointer.</p>

  <p>The corner three-point shot has also evolved over the last 20 years. In the early 2000s, corner three-pointers were often times a last resort shot that any player would take if the 24-second shot clock was running out. As players began to model their game around three-point shooting, certain players found a role as spot-up corner shooters. Players prefer the corner three-point shot because it is the shortest three-point shot and the easiest to perfect because it’s right along the sideline, limiting the length of the shot. It is very easy for players to get in rhythm from the corner, allowing players to heat up and shoot the lights out.</p>

  <p>To learn more about the evolution of the three-pointer, I spoke with shooting coach and former collegiate basketball player Ricky Ashton. Ricky grew up in Houston Texas and has been playing basketball from a young age. Ricky started as a football player but after one summer of practicing basketball, he made the varsity basketball team as a freshman. After getting no looks in high school, Ricky was recruited to a junior college in Kansas. After playing basketball for 2 years, Ricky went to a private 4-year school in Missouri. </p>

  <p>After University, Ricky returned to Houston to start coaching players trying to improve their craft. Ricky told me that “he was always a shooter” but appreciated that every position had its strengths and weaknesses, with centers playing in the post and point guards facilitating the offense. One thing that Ricky prides himself on is that he gets the hardest work from his students. His slogan, “Quit or Get Better” is found all over his Instagram page and website. Ricky says “As long as they work hard, they’ll get better”. Ricky has trained people as young as middle schoolers up to NBA players. DJ Augustin, a former NBA player started training with Ricky after his first year with the Orlando Magic. He wanted to get his three-point shot better. Ricky found that his jumper was not square and he had a weak foundation “To have a good jump shot, like in life, you need a solid foundation” Ricky told me. One thing Ricky was proud of was that DJ Augustin got one of the larger contracts for a role player after improving his three-point shot. Ricky has also trained NBA players Danuel House, Jerami Grant, and his personal friend, Justice Winslow.</p>

<p>Ricky is not a fan of analytics. He believes it is ruining coaching, and not putting players in a place to succeed. However, “in life, everything changes”. Ricky used to teach centers to “get low, like Shaq, like Kareem”, but now teaches players to “take what is given to them”. This is no exception to Three-Point Shooters. Ricky told me that coaching in the NBA is not what it used to be anymore, and it might play a part in shooting. When coaches try to manage a new team like the team they used to coach, they don’t know where each player thrives. Leaving players to resort to their most comfortable shot, which is often times a three-point shot. Another aspect that is allowing players to hit more three-point shots is the reintegration of players who prefer to drive to the rim. Players like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Giannis Antetokounmpo are such dominant players in the paint, that the defense has to collapse to try and stop the easy layup. As a result, players find themselves open at the three-point line, especially the corner because it is the furthest area for a defensive player to rotate to. </p>

<p>Some players have been in the league much longer than they should have been because they are lights-out shooters. Players like PJ Tucker, Reggie Bullock, Steve Novak, and Matt Bonner were able to survive in a more physical NBA by being experts at their craft. Below, are the top 9 corner three-point shooters in the league last season. </p>
